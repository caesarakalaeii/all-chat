/**
 * TikTok Listener Service
 *
 * Connects to TikTok LIVE streams using the unofficial TikTok-Live-Connector library
 * and publishes chat messages to Redis Streams for processing.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This service uses an UNOFFICIAL library based on reverse engineering.
 * When TikTok releases an official Live Chat API, this should be replaced.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Monitors multiple TikTok live streams simultaneously
 * - Publishes raw messages to Redis Streams (chat:raw)
 * - Dynamic stream management (add/remove channels)
 * - Health check HTTP endpoint
 * - Graceful shutdown
